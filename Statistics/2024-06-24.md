### Basic Statistics Refresher
```markdown
1. Mean - The average value.
2. Median - The value that occurs in the middle of an ordered data set.
3. Mode - The most frequent occuring value.
4. Variance - It measures the dispersion of a set of data points around their mean.
```
Notes for Variance: \
Variance is how much "distance" apart is the value from the Mean. \
Mathmatically its defined as such: (while N is the dataset length and.. \
x sub i which is the point at the ith or nth value   
$${x_i}$$ 
and...
 "mu" (μ) is the mean.
 
$$ Variance =\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2 $$
$$ Where\ \sigma \ = standard \ deviation $$
