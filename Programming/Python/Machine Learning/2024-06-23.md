Did you know that you can initalize the input shape in tensorflow for model sequence in the first Dense layer? LOL..

```
model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

Do you see the "input_shape=(10,)" this means: \
The shape of the input data that your model expects. 
The parameter specifies the shape of the input data that will be fed into the first layer of your neural network model. It's an important parameter because it defines the dimensionality of your input data, which helps the framework allocate the right amount of memory and perform operations correctly.


(10,) This tuple specifies that the input data is one-dimensional and has 10 elements per sample. In this example, each input sample is expected to be a vector (or array) of length 10.
