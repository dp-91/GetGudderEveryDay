Did you know you can essentially put your code block preserving your spacing/tabbing structure by using:  
 ==> \`\`\` (three backticks starting and ending): \`\`\` YOUR CODE \`\`\`: \
 Example below:

```
    def someFunction(param):
        return param === param
```

Cool right?

Traditional I used the (single backtick method starting and ending) \` OLD WAY YOUR CODE \`
Example below: \
`
def someFunction(param) {
    return param === param
}
