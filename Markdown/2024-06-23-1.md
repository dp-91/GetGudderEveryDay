Did you know you can specify the language for syntax highlighting in a code block check it out: \
\`\`\`python \
YOUR CODE \
\`\`\`

Notice how there's "python" after the first three backticks that lets markdown know how it should evaulate the following code block:

Python
```python
def doCoolStuff():
    #secret
    return

def coolFunction():
    return doCoolStuff()
```

SQL
```sql
UPDATE BankAccounts
SET Cash = 9223372036854775807
WHERE User = 'ME';
-- :P
```
